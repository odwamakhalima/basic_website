                                                           The Museum houses more than one and a half million specimens of scientific importance.
                                                           For nearly 200 years scientists at the Museum have been adding to these collections and studying them.

                                                           The materials used to build the Castle were local and included rock cut from the granite outcrop on Signal Hill.
                                                           It provides great intro in the dark past of the city.
